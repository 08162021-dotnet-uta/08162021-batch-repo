# Week 1 Topics

## SCM = source control management (GitHub)

- VCS = version control system
- Roles and Permissions
- Processes
- Environments
- Deployments
- Artifacts
- Project Management

## VCS = version control system (Git)

- source code
- tracking
- branch
- history
- code management/review
- centralized vs distributed

## Git

- git init = initialize the repository
- git add = ability to select the resources to track
- git commit = ability to save the changes of the selected resources
- git push = sync from local to remote
- git pull = sync from remote to local
- git clone = initial sync/copy from remote to local
- git status = print the current state of the repository
- git log = print the history of the repository
- git branch = create a new parallel branch to the source code
- git config = configure your user information to the repository

## CLI = command line interface

- emulator = application that give access to a shell
- shell = interface to your os/kernel
- pwd = print our current path
- ls = list the current resources in your path
- mkdir = create a directory/folder
- touch = create a file
- rm = remove/delete a path
- mv = move/drag resource from 1 path to another, rename
- cd = navigate between paths

## .NET

- platform = Web, Mobile, Desktop, Drivers, Data, AI/ML, VR/MR/AR, Gaming
- languages = C#, F#, JS, Python, VB, VB.NET, Java Runtime, C, C++, SQL, MongoDB
- sdk = software development kit, .NET Standard (StdLib)
- .NET Framework = windows only (100%)
- .NET Core = all OS
- Web = ASP.NET (MVC, WebAPI, SignalR, WCF)
- Mobile = Xamarin (iOS, iPadOS, macOS supported, Android)
- Desktop = UWP/UAP, XAML (windows only)
- Drivers = .NET StdLib
- Data = Entity Framework, ADO.NET
- AI/ML = ML.NET (machine learning, neural networks)
- VR/MR/AR = Hololens, Azure Vision
- Gaming = Unity Engine

## dotnet

- new = create a new project/solution
- build = compile the code
- run =  execute the code

## C#

- statically-typed language and strongly-typed language
- primitive types (int, long, float, double, bool, string, char, short, byte, decimal)
- scopes (namespace, class/struct, method, block)
- compilation/runtime process
- .NET Assembly = CIL (common intermediate language), DLL, EXE, SVC
- CLR = common language runtime (BCL, CTS, VES, JIT)
- value vs reference types = leverage the content in memory (deep copy) or leverage the address in memory (shallow copy)
- type inference = the content of the variable sets the variable type (not predefined)
- parsing vs casting (implicit, explicit)
- boxing vs unboxing
- access modifiers =  accessibility levels, private, public, protected, internal

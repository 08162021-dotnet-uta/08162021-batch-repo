Challenge - Datatypes And Variables

Now that you know how to declare and initialize Variables, please go ahead 
and create a variable for each of the primitive datatypes (you can find 
the list here). Leave the Object datatype out.
And also please initialize each variable with a working value.
Then create two values of type string. 
The first one should say "I control text"

The second one should be a whole number. Create a method that uses the Parse method in order to convert that string to an integer.

Add each an output for each of the variables and write it onto the console. (WriteLine)
